Development Outline
====================

Non programming Enhancements
----------------------------
* Better sample of realistic severity curves
* Better sample of by line aggregate Blocks in YAML
* Credit modeling: what is distortion implied by bond credit curve? By cat bond pricing?
* Jon Evans note and severity
* Jed note

Short term
-----------
* Sev by name from examples in spec sev_a = name
* Different freq dists and freq dist in exact mode, shape a, b
* issue with mass and bodoff1 portfolio
* Distortion that is the P/L convex envelope of a set of given points
* Errors with mass! Finite vs infinite supported distributions, lep vs ly and clin?!
* Understand output for collateral and priority!
* Output Levy measure
* Funky objects from JS? Simple jump examples

Medium Term
------------
* Estimate Bucket function! Auto update
* IME review paper example?

Nice to have enhancements
-------------------------
* Agg limit and attachment
* How to model two reinstatements?
* $N\mid N \ge n$ distribution?
