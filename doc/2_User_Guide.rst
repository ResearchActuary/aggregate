User Guide
==============

The User Guide shows how ``aggregate`` can be used to solve a specific actuarial problem. It alternates between problem-based guides and reference guides. Each is in a separate short document. Many of the guides include a video presentation.

Guides marked *problem* are user and problem based and describe what ``aggregate`` can do.
Those marked *reference* are learning based and describe how ``aggregate`` works. In a driving analogy, problems are possible destinations; reference describes how to unlock the car, start the engine, and engage a gear. Or in cooking, problems are recipes and reference material describes techniques such as broiling or making pastry.
