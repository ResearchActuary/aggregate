Modes of Large Account Analysis
--------------------------------

IR pricing is based on an estimated loss pick, possibly supplemented by distribution and volatility statistics such as loss standard deviation or quantiles. ``aggregate`` can compute the loss pick for specific covers (analogous to an excess of loss treaty) and aggregate covers (analogous to a treaty with an aggregate limit and deductible). The former application is peripheral to the underlying purpose of ``aggregate``, but is very convenient nonetheless, while the latter is a showcase application.

The IR, or its risk retention vehicle, is concerned with the loss pick and understanding the impact of the insurance contract on the distribution of retained losses. IR pricing actuaries often want the full gross and retained (net, after insurance) outcome distributions.
