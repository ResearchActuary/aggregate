Vectorization: Limit Profiles and Mixed Severity
-------------------------------------------------------

**Prerequisites:**  Examples use ``build`` and ``qd``, and basic :class:`Aggregate` output.

Using Limit Profile with Mixed Severity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Limit profiles (:doc:`065_limit_profiles`) and severity mixtures
(:doc:`060_mixed_severity`) can be combined. Each mixed severity is applied
to each limit profile component. For example, three limit bands and a
severity with two mixture components creates an aggregate with six severity
sub-components. The ``report_df`` dataframe shows the components.

.. ipython:: python
    :okwarning:

    from aggregate import build, qd
    a11 = build('agg DecL:11 '
               '[10 20 30] claims '
               '[100 200 75] xs [0 50 75] '
               'sev lognorm 100 cv [1 2] wts [0.6 0.4] '
               'poisson')
    qd(a11)
    qd(a11.report_df.loc[['limit', 'attachment', 'freq_m',
      'agg_m', 'agg_cv']].T.iloc[:-4])


**Example.** We can combine the mixed exponential from :ref:`med example`
with a limits profile.

.. ipython:: python
    :okwarning:

    from aggregate import build, qd
    a12 = build('agg DecL:12 [20 8 4 2] claims [1e6, 2e6 5e6 10e6] xs 0 '
                     'sev [2.764e3 24.548e3 275.654e3 1.917469e6 10e6] * '
                     'expon 1 wts [0.824796 0.159065 0.014444 0.001624, 0.000071] fixed',
                     log2=18, bs=500)
    qd(a12)


The ``report_df`` shows all 20 components: 4 limits x 5 mixture components.

.. ipython:: python
    :okwarning:

    qd(a12.report_df.loc[['limit', 'attachment', 'freq_m',
      'agg_m', 'agg_cv']].T.iloc[:-4])




Circumventing Products: Modeling Multiple Units in One Aggregate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


If the weights sum to one then the result is an exposure / severity outer
product, treated as a mixed severity. If the weights are missing or
sum to the number of severity components (e.g.Â are all equal to 1) then the
result is an item by item combination, circumventing the outer product.

It is sometimes desirable circumventing the outer product rather than taking
the product of every limit with every severity mixture component. There are
two cases where we actually want to enter a series of limits each with their
own severity.

#. Two or more units each with a different severity but with a shared mixing
   variable. For example, to model two units with expected losses 100 and
   200, one with a gamma mean 10 CV 1 severity and the other lognormal mean
   15 CV 1.5 and both sharing a gamma mixing variable::

      agg MixedPremReserve
      [100 200] claims
      sev [gamma lognorm] [10 15] cv [1 1.5]
      mixed gamma 0.4

   The result should be the two-way combination, not the four-way exposure and
   severity product.

#. Exposures with different limits may have different severity curves. Again,
   the limit profile and severity curves should all be broadcast together at
   once, rather than broadcasting limits and severities separately and then
   taking the outer product::

      agg Eg4
      [10 10 10] claims
      [1000 2000 5000] xs 0
      sev lognorm [50 100 150] cv [0.1 0.15 0.2]
      poisson



**Example.** The next two examples illustrate the different behavior. First,
there two units with different limits and severities and no weights.
``report_df`` shows there are only two components modeled.

.. ipython:: python
   :okwarning:

   a13 = build('agg DecL:13 '
              '[10 20] claims '
              '[1000 2000] xs 0 '
              'sev [gamma lognorm] [10 15] cv [1 1.5] '
              'mixed gamma 0.4 ')
   qd(a13)
   qd(a13.report_df.loc[['limit', 'attachment', 'freq_m',
      'agg_m', 'agg_cv']].T.iloc[:-4])


Adding weights results in a mixed severity, 80% for the gamma and 20% for lognormal. Now ``report_df``
shows that each limit band is combined with each severity, resulting in four modeled components.

.. ipython:: python
   :okwarning:

   a14 = build('agg DecL:14 '
              '[10 20] claims '
              '[1000 2000] xs 0 '
              'sev [gamma lognorm] [10 15] cv [1 1.5] wts [.8 .2] '
              'mixed gamma 0.4 ')
   qd(a14)
      qd(a14.report_df.loc[['limit', 'attachment', 'freq_m',
      'agg_m', 'agg_cv']].T.iloc[:-4])
