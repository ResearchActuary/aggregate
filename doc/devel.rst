Development Outline
====================

Non programming Enhancements
----------------------------
* Better sample of realistic severity curves
* Better sample of by line aggregate Blocks in YAML
* Credit modeling: what is distortion implied by bond credit curve? By cat bond pricing?
* Jon Evans note and severity
* Jed note

Short term
-----------
* Different freq dists and freq dist in exact mode, shape a, b
* Fix test cases!!
* issue with mass and bodoff1 portfolio
* Distortion that is the P/L convex envelope of a set of given points
* Errors with mass! Finite vs infinite supported distributions, lep vs ly and clin?!
* Understand output for collateral and priority!
* Output Levy measure
* Funky objects from JacodS? Simple jump examples

Medium Term
------------
* Estimate Bucket function! Auto update
* Style reports
* An about me report; better str and repr methods
* More consistent and informative reports and plots (e.g. include severity match in agg)
* Convex Hull distortion built from pricing
* Delete items easily from the database
* Save / load from non-YAML, persist the database; dict to agg language converter? Get rid of YAML dependence
* Using agg as a severity (how!)
* Name as a member in dict vs list conniptions (put up with duplication?)


Nice to have enhancements
-------------------------
* Agg limit and attachment: NO already have when you can use an agg as a severity
* How to model two reinstatements?
* $N\mid N \ge n$ distribution?
