# TODO stack

`np.newaxis`, x=x[:, np.newaxis]


* Extract Python from rst
* reins summaries in re section? [rather than by hand]; describe in DecL section
* scale all graph plots! what are standards?
* constants module in agg?

0. Add exposure / rate keywords for 10 exposure at 1200 rate ? Is that in docs?
0. Uncertainty principle for bs: too small not enough space; too large miss features of sev; for given n there is a min possible error
1.
1. qd looks for like columns / column format guesser?
2. poisson poisson distribution  = neyman type a
3. ZM and ZT
3. cat paper; match Jewson; ILW pricing?
4. rec bucket - do some testing to determine a good p.
5. Update efficiently - used anywhere?
6. Aggregate.en is unreliable; where/how is it used
7. sev_cdf etc. are unrealiable for pdfs when there are masses
8. with picks the analytic severities are not altered...be careful!
9. with picks you should invalidate / reompute statistics etc.
10. with cession you should recompute statistics? or make clear it is gross/
11. Formatting for MultiIndex with gup (reins_audit_df) messed up because not float
12. Install in Ubuntu
13. Add script for intall from source into readme.rst
14. References!!!!
15. This fails:  s = build('sev LG loggamma 10 cv .5') and for Pareto
16. dot in names fuck up things eg analyze_distortion (seems colon works)
17. Update reins section for latest re object attributes

6. local moment matching ? for the first few points? jnwts (juice not worth the squeeze)



## Done

* forward and backward computation; discrete -> round method
* pass recommend_p as arg to build
* correct width for qd and what displays in pdf?



## Considered and rejected


AAS Paper!
