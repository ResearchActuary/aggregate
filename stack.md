# TODO stack

0. Add exposure / rate keywords for 10 exposure at 1200 rate ?

1. qd looks for like columns / column format guesser?
2. poisson poisson distribution  = neyman type a
3. ZM and ZT
3. cat paper; match Jewson; ILW pricing?
4. rec bucket - do some testing to determine a good p.
5. Update efficiently - used anywhere?
6. Aggregate.en is unreliable; where/how is it used
7. sev_cdf etc. are unrealiable for pdfs when there are masses
8. with picks the analytic severities are not altered...be careful!
9. with picks you should invalidate / reompute statistics etc.
10. with cession you should recompute statistics? or make clear it is gross/
