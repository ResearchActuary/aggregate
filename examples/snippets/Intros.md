# V01: A First Introduction to `aggregate`

**Objectives** Introduce aggregate probability distributions and the `aggregate` library for working with them. 

**Audience** New user with no knowlege of aggregate distributions or insurance.

**Prerequisites** Basic probability theory; Python and pandas programming.

**Context** Up next: `aggregate` for Actuarial Students.

**Overview**
1. Definition of aggregate (compound) probability distributions.
2. Applications and examples.
3. Installing the `aggregate` package.
4. Simple discrete examples illustrating using dice throws.
5. Determining moments of and plotting aggregate distributions.


# V02: `aggregate` for Actuarial Students 

**Objectives** Introduce aggregate probability distributions and the `aggregate` library for working with them in the context of exam and university courses in actuarial modeling. 

**Audience** Actuarial science university student or junior analyst working in insurance.

**Prerequisites** V01 plus familiarity with aggregate probability distribution (as covered on SOA STAM, CAS MAS I, IFOA CS-2) and basic insurance terminology (insurance company operations).

**Context** Up next: `aggregate` for Actuaries.

**Overview**
1. Installing the `aggregate` package.
2. Working with simple discrete aggregate probability distributions.
3. Determining moments of and plotting aggregate distributions.


# V03: `aggregate` for Actuaries 

**Objectives** Introduce aggregate probability distributions and the `aggregate` library for working with then in the context of real-world, but basic, actuarial problems 
illustrated using the Tweedie distribution from GLM modeling. 

**Audience** Actuaries at the Associate or Fellow level.

**Prerequisites** V02 plus awareness of the use aggregate probability distribution in insurance (as covered on CAS Part 8).

**Context** Up next: `aggregate` for individual risk pricing actuaries.

**Overview**
1. Installing the `aggregate` package.
2. Computing an aggregate distribution for a portfolio of risks with given frequency, severity, limit, and attachment assumptions.
3. Different ways to determine exposure (prem x lr; claim count; losses).
4. Determining limited expected values.

For each audience there is a customized `Underwriter` object 

## Basic prequisies for all introductions

* Basic probability including discrete and continuous distributions, mean, variance, standard deviation, pdf, cdf. 
* Python programming, including familiarity with `pandas`. `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `scipy.stats` useful but not essential.
